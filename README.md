## Challenge Overview
This was my first attempt at writing code with Python. Compaired to VBA, Python was much easier to work with, organize, and spot bugs as they happened. Naming varibales, and tabbing for loops and if statements were much cleaner and easier to see. I can see the benifit of Python coding when it easily worked though hundreds of thousands of data points quickly and was able to notify about bugs before running the code.

## Challenge Summary.
The ability to join csv files, create and write txt files to output the finidings can be helpful for the end user and compiling a clean report. I ran into a particulare challenge with joining the original election_analysis.csv file from my Resources file. An error of file not foudn would pop up despite running the code before writing it to a txt file. This was resolved by.:
I also had a challenge with pushing my changes to the election_analysis file through my Terminal to my GitHub repositry. Having previously created a token in Pre-Work of this program I was not able to porperly link it through my terminal. This was resolved by:
